I'd like to give some special thanks to some people who (conciously or not) helped me to create this game.

Snabisch for the music (On the day of our death)
Jute for some sound effects
To the guys who created the assets I used from the Unity Asset Store
And finally, to Saty, a friend of mine who gave me ideas and motivation.
